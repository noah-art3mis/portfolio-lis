# Stuff I did during my Master's at LIS

Most projects have corresponding .pdf files in this repository.

## What is AI slop?

Research paper on what AI slop is - using thematic analysis, topic modelling and statistics on quantitative linguistic features. Outlines the types, themes, metaphors, and qualities of slop. Also finds that slop news is less varied and more positive than human-written high-quality news.

## Intersect

Access website [here](https://intersect.streamlit.app/).

Job board web app which uses NLP to "combine what you want with what you need" - in practice, to reorder results using techniques such as semantic similarity (with user-provided text) and cross-encoders (reranking). Uses dimensionality reduction and clustering to make a cool plot.

## The Eros Engine

Access prototype [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/CngNPoctG33cqbcFwNzzDs/DESIDERATA?node-id=83-273&p=f&t=dy8y9PikvJEPAJBp-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=63%3A129&starting-point-node-id=83%3A273).

Figma prototype of a hentai (anime pornography) website which creates AI-generated images based on user preferences - without them having to explicitly say them. Has a main character (inspired by game design and visual novels) which "handles" the engine and also transforms their appearance based on user preference. What would it look like if recommendation algorithms had your best interest in mind? What it would look like if AI was used to celebrate the diversity of human sexuality instead of creating offensively generic, cisheteronormative slop?

## Xenofeminism

Slides on trans, post-communist, rationalist, technomaterialist, ontonaturalist, gender-abolitionist, biohacking cyberfeminism. Self-explanatory.

My personal collection of people on tumblr saying unhinged stuff in a very specific way.

## Others:

-   **Who deports more, Republicans or Democrats?**: Analysis of United States deportation data. Hopelessly outdated now. See repository [here](https://github.com/noah-art3mis/stats-assignment-2).
-   **Visual analysis**: a visual analysis of a painting by Zdzisław Beksiński.
-   **Neurophysiological Effects of Architectural Styles in Virtual Reality**: fake neuroarchitecture paper that uses EEG and VR to test if there truly is a "universal attraction to vitality" - that is, to see if brutalism is objectively ugly. Since I like xenofeminism, you can guess my opinion on this topic.
-   **Is psychoanalysis a pseudoscience?**: short paper on psychoanalysis and science, leveraging my background in both psychology and philosophy of science.
-   **Is This True Interdisciplinarity? A Case Study of an Interdisciplinary Journal Paper**: critical essay on integration. Do you have to use certain words and follow certain methods to be considered interdisciplinary, or is publishing interesting work enough? That is, do you have to follow the tradition of the "discipline of interdisciplinarity"? Isn't the whole point of interdisciplinarity not to engage in this?
-   **CCUS**: Mostly descriptive analysis of data on carbon capture projects. See repository [here](https://github.com/noah-art3mis/everything-counts-1).
-   **The Radiant Capital** and **The New New Capital**: slide decks that attempt to address the notorious public transport issue in Brasilia, Brazil (my hometown) through the stupidest possible method: diverting money from the current (reasonably effective) solutions to build a bold, innovative, and hopeful light-rail network that only serves the rich part of the city. The epitome of "pra inglês ver".
